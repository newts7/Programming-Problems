Do you want a story?
No! Let's get straight to business.

You are given an array of N strings,You need to sort the array in lexographical order.
Only move allowed while sorting is you can only swap strings at adjacent positions.That means
You can swap :
1. String A<sub>i</sub> with String A<sub>i+1</sub>
2. String A<sub>i</sub> with String A<sub>i-1</sub>

You need to output the minimum number of moves it will take to sort the Array.

Input
An integer N(<=1000) denoting the size of array.
N strings on every next line, where i<sup>th</sup> string denotes string A<sub>i</sub>(length of each string<=10)

Output
An integer denoting the minimum number of moves.

Sample Input
5
Catelyn
Jon
Sansa
Winterfell
Arya

Sample Output
4

Explanation:
It will take 4 moves to move Arya from 5th to 1st position.
